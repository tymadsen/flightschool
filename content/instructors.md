## Jeff Johnson - Owner: 

Jeff grew up involved in aviation. He was too young to remember his first flight in a plane. His family owned a Cessna 152 and a V-Tail Beech Bonanza and would fly regularly. He knew at a very young age that he wanted to be a pilot when he grew up. Unfortunately, though, by age 12, his family had sold both aircraft. A few years later however, at age 17, he began building a kit aircraft, a Zodiac CH601XL, with his dad and uncle and he was tossed back into the world of aviation. He began his flight training in 2010 and received his commercial certificate and became a Certified Flight Instructor in early 2017, having taken a few years off from training to marry the love of his life and have a daughter. After a short year of being a full-time flight instructor, he was head-hunted to be the corporate pilot for a small construction company where he still works today. Jeff lives in northern Utah with his wife and 3 (soon to be 4) children. He has over 2,300 flight hours and continues to build airplanes in his spare time. Jeff is an avid volunteer in the aviation community, providing service to the EAA, flying in the Young Eagles program, Angel Flight, free ground school classes, and working VIP hospitality at the Reno National Championship Air Races.

## Brian Laws - Flight Instructor

Brian is a third generation pilot, so becoming a pilot was just a natural progression in life. He says as an instructor, thereâ€™s nothing more satisfying than training new pilots, from discovery flight, first solo, to shaking hands with the DPE as they achieve their first pilots license. As a CFI/CFII, he also enjoys working for Idaho Flight Academy, where safety is paramount. He hopes to one day be an airline pilot and continue to provide excellent customer service.

## Andrew Lechtenberg - Director of Flight Operations

Andrew is the Director of Flights Operations for Idaho Flight Academy.

It was there that he discovered his passion for aviation. Soon after, he left his job and completed his flight training. In addition to being our Director of Flight Operations, he flies for SkyWest Airlines.

Originally from sunny St. George, Utah, he also spent time growing up in San Francisco and Atlanta. He now lives in Salt Lake City, with his wife and daughter.
