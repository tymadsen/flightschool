##### Every rating you achieve has a 3 part test you will have to undergo. We’re here to help you with all 3! You will have a written examination, oral examination, and practical examination. We’ve included the costs of those in our [pricing](/pricing) layout.

### Written

In preparation for your written test, you will work through a ground course with one of our Certified Flight Instructors, who will be there to guide you and answer any questions along the way. Your written test can be completed at any time (before or during your flight training) and will test your knowledge of the rules, regulations, and various topics pertinent to flying an airplane in a written format. This will be administered by the FAA. 

### Oral 

Your next exams will come after the completion of your flight training, where you’ll be tested by a Designated Pilot Examiner, who will first gauge your knowledge through an oral evaluation. You’ll be asked to answer various questions and demonstrate different planning techniques used to conduct a safe flight with the knowledge you’ve accumulated in your training. 

### Practical 

Your last test will be conducted on that same day and will be a practical evaluation of your flying skills, in the airplane. You’ll demonstrate the different maneuvers and procedures learned during your flight training.
