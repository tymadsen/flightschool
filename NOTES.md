Our team:
Brian Laws - Flight Instructor: Brian is a third generation pilot, so becoming a pilot was just a natural progression in life. He says as an instructor, there’s nothing more satisfying than training new pilots, from discovery flight, first solo, to shaking hands with the DPE as they achieve their first pilots license. As a CFI/CFII, he also enjoys working for Idaho Flight Academy, where safety is paramount. He hopes to one day be an airline pilot and continue to provide excellent customer service.

Jeff Johnson - Owner: 
Andrew Lechtenberg - Director of Flight Operations: Andrew is the Director of Flights Operations for Idaho Flight Academy. 

Andrew grew up wanting to pursue a career in corporate business, like his dad. Upon completing his bachelor's degree in finance, he moved to Dallas, TX to work for American Airlines. It was there that he discovered his passion for aviation. Soon after, he left his job and completed his flight training. In addition to being our Director of Flight Operations, he flies for SkyWest Airlines.

Originally from sunny St. George, Utah, he also spent time growing up in San Francisco and Atlanta. He now lives in Salt Lake City, with his wife and daughter.

Curriculum:
Every rating you achieve has a 3 part test you will have to undergo. We’re here to help you with all 3! You will have a written examination, oral examination, and practical examination. We’ve included the costs of those in our pricing layout. In preparation for your written test, you will work through a ground course with one of our Certified Flight Instructors, who will be there to guide you and answer any questions along the way. Your written test can be completed at any time (before or during your flight training) and will test your knowledge of the rules, regulations, and various topics pertinent to flying an airplane in a written format. This will be administered by the FAA. Your next exams will come after the completion of your flight training, where you’ll be tested by a Designated Pilot Examiner, who will first gauge your knowledge through an oral evaluation. You’ll be asked to answer various questions and demonstrate different planning techniques used to conduct a safe flight with the knowledge you’ve accumulated in your training. Your last test will be conducted on that same day and will be a practical evaluation of your flying skills, in the airplane. You’ll demonstrate the different maneuvers and procedures learned during your flight training. We’ve trained hundreds of successful pilots and are here to help you join the ranks!

Opportunities:
There is a world full of opportunities available to pilots: Airline pilot, corporate pilot, flight instructor, bush pilot, crop dusting, charter pilot, designated pilot examiner… the sky is truly the limit. There are part time opportunities and full time opportunities, and some can be very lucrative. There’s never been a better time to become a pilot. Even if you just love flying as a hobby, it’s an incredible community to be a part of. There are so many clubs and organizations to be a part of as a recreational flyer. Come get started today!

Jeff: Jeff grew up involved in aviation. He was too young to remember his first flight in a plane. His family owned a Cessna 152 and a V-Tail Beech Bonanza and would fly regularly. He knew at a very young age that he wanted to be a pilot when he grew up. Unfortunately, though, by age 12, his family had sold both aircraft. A few years later however, at age 17, he began building a kit aircraft, a Zodiac CH601XL, with his dad and uncle and he was tossed back into the world of aviation. He began his flight training in 2010 and received his commercial certificate and became a Certified Flight Instructor in early 2017, having taken a few years off from training to marry the love of his life and have a daughter. After a short year of being a full-time flight instructor, he was head-hunted to be the corporate pilot for a small construction company where he still works today. Jeff lives in northern Utah with his wife and 3 (soon to be 4) children. He has over 2,300 flight hours and continues to build airplanes in his spare time. Jeff is an avid volunteer in the aviation community, providing service to the EAA, flying in the Young Eagles program, Angel Flight, free ground school classes, and working VIP hospitality at the Reno National Championship Air Races.

Reese: Reese Sadowski is our Social Media Marketer and student with the academy for a year now. Besides flying he can be found hiking and otherwise enjoying his time outdoors.
